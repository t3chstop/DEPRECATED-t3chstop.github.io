							<h1 class="major">I'm a 3D artist</h1>
							<p>It's been 2 years since I started using blender. Over the years, I have modeled and textured hundreds of models and progressed greatly as an artist. I mostly use blender, although I have also used Substance Painter, the Quixels suite, Unreal engine and Unity. A few of my best renders are linked below</p>
                            <p> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rXU7ofo4n_7Bk_GYu4gs4sL6TqToiUP3/view?usp=sharing">Here</a> is my watch render. I made this in January 2021. I challenged myself to complete the entire render as quickly as possible while maintaining detailed quality.</p>
                            <p> <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/192mOlq3A_dhPSE_oGkg-lxB2WFXVJwsC/view?usp=sharing">Here</a> is my nature render. Due to the intense vertex count required to make a render of such detail, I had to really optimize my assets so that my mid-range laptop could accomodate them. I resorted to several denoising and texture based methods to get the project as lightweight as possible. This render was made at 2 samples.</p>
